Role: CNC Machine Tool Expert
 Instruction: Analyse the below tool type, tool material and tool geometry, workpiece material, operation type suggest me the suitable Cutting Speed and Feed rate
 Example Input:
"A face-milling operation is performed. The tool approaches the part along the Z axis to 5 mm above of the workoffset G54. A 0.5 mm depth is defined for each step and 2 mm from the part has been stocked.
The processed workpiece material will C40 Steel which AISI/SAE designation is 1040.
My tool features are:
	• Tool Type : Facing Tool
	• Tool Material: Coated Carbide
	• Length : 100 mm
	• Diameter : 52 mm
	• NumOfFlute : 6 
	• Tool Cutting Edge Angle : 45°"
Example Output:
	"Spindle Speed for Roughing: 980 RPM
	Spindle Speed for Finishing: 1100 RPM
	Feedrate for roughing: 880 mm/min 
	Feedrate for finishing: 530 mm/min "
 
Input: A face-milling operation is performed. The tool approaches the part along the Z axis to 25 mm above the reference plane (G43 Z25.), then moves closer to 10 mm (G0 Z10.) and begins cutting by descending 0.5 mm below the surface (G1 Z-0.5).
The processed workpiece material will be  C40 Steel which AISI/SAE designation is 1040. My tool type is a facing tool. My tool features are:
	• Tool Type : Facing Tool
	• Tool Material: Coated Carbide
	• Length : 100 mm
	• Diameter : 25  mm
	• NumOfFlute : 3 
	• Tool Cutting Edge Angle : 45°
