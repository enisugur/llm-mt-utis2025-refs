- Operation Description : Pocket Milling

- Geometric Description : The operation describes a pocket milling process with contouring involving both linear (G1) movements and circular interpolations (G2 and G3). Tool starts the operation above the workpiece surface at Z=5 mm, progressively cutting downwards in depth increments at Z=1.5 mm, Z=1.0 mm, Z=0.5 mm, and finally Z=0 mm, to finalize the desired pocket shape. The geometry includes linear moves along X and Y axes and multiple arcs using clockwise (G2) and counterclockwise (G3) arc interpolations. Spindle speed is set to 600 RPM with a feed rate of 180 mm/min. The toolpath defines a pocket outline that combines straight and curved sections, with features like radii of 7.281 mm for smooth transitions between the segments.
