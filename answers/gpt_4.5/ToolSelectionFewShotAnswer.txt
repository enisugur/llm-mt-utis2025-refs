Tool Type : Facing Tool  
Length : 80 mm  
Diameter : 50 mm  
NumOfFlute : 4  
Tool Cutting Edge Angle : 45°  
Tool Material : Carbide Inserts (ISO P-type recommended)  

Explanation :  
For the described face-milling operation having low depth of cut per step (0.5 mm) and moderate cutting conditions (600 RPM spindle speed and 180 mm/min feedrate), a facing tool equipped with carbide inserts (ISO P-type) is highly recommended. This choice ensures superior wear resistance, efficient heat dissipation, and excellent surface finish at moderate speeds.  

Tool Geometry Parameters Suggestion:  
- Diameter : 50 mm, to provide an adequate cutting width for efficient face milling  
- Number of Flutes: 4, optimal balance between chip removal, surface finish, and effective machining at specified feedrate and spindle speed  
- Cutting Edge Angle : 45°, recommended to efficiently balance cutting pressure, minimize vibrations, and maximize stability while performing face milling operations.
