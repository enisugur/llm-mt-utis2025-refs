Explanation from CNC Machine Tool Experts:

Expert 1: CNC Milling Tool Specialist
Considering the described face-milling operation, the appropriate tool type would clearly be a face mill cutter, preferably with multiple carbide insert teeth to maximize productivity. The optimal cutting tool material would be cemented carbide inserts (WC-Co), as this would provide durability and excellent performance at the stated cutting parameters. Since the operation depth is small (0.5 mm per pass), I recommend inserts with positive rake geometry, moderate relief angles, and relatively sharp cutting edges to reduce cutting forces and enhance surface finish.

Expert 2: Tooling Materials Specialist
Given the prescribed machining conditions (600 RPM and 180 mm/min), the cutting speed remains relatively moderate; hence, a carbide insert face-milling cutter would suffice. An uncoated carbide insert can handle this comfortably; however, I strongly advise using coated carbide inserts (such as TiCN or TiAlN coatings) to improve tool life and reduce wear rate, particularly for consistency in repetitive passes. Geometry-wise, selecting inserts with positive rake angles and suitably combined chip breaker geometry would enhance chip evacuation and surface quality.

Expert 3: CNC Machining Process Engineer
Analyzing the machining scenario provided, the optimal selection is definitely a face milling cutter with indexable carbide inserts due to economy and efficiency. However, even with moderate cutting speed conditions (spindle speed = 600 RPM at given feedrate), an adequately coated carbide insert (preferably TiAlN) is highly advisable for maximum productivity and consistent surface finish. Tool geometry would ideally feature positive rake angles, moderate clearance angles, and slightly round corner radius edges for improved stability and surface integrity even in shallow depths of cut.

Expert 4: CNC Application Technician
According to this face-milling process description, an indexable face milling cutting tool is undoubtedly ideal. In my opinion, carbide inserts, whether coated or not, would sufficiently handle this moderate speed and shallow depth machining operation. Though coated inserts (like TiCN) provide clear advantages in terms of longevity, plain carbide might reduce unnecessary costs if volume is small. A positive rake angle with moderate clearance angles and relatively sharp inserts without too large corner radii should yield improved finish and maintain accuracy at small depths.

Expert Discussion and Conflict Resolution:
- All experts unanimously agree that a face mill cutter with carbide inserts would be the appropriate tool type for this machining task.
- Expert 1 suggests coated carbide inserts (WC-Co) for efficient performance.
- Expert 2 strongly advocates for coated carbide inserts with TiCN or TiAlN coating due to enhanced tool life and wear resistance, even though conditions are moderate.
- Expert 3 similarly emphasizes coated carbide inserts (preferably TiAlN coating) to increase performance consistency, especially with repetitive milling operations.
- Expert 4 agrees on carbide inserts but introduces the possibility of cost savings by utilizing non-coated carbide inserts, provided the operation volume remains low.

Final Summary after Conflict Resolution:
- Recommended Tool Type: Face milling cutter with multiple indexable carbide inserts.
- Recommended Tool Material: Coated carbide inserts (preferably TiCN or TiAlN). However, non-coated carbide inserts could also be considered if budget or low production volume is critical.
- Recommended Tool Geometry Features: Positive rake angle geometry, moderate clearance angles, and relatively sharp cutting edges. Inserts with a slight corner radius may be beneficial to improve stability and surface finish during shallow cutting depth operations.
