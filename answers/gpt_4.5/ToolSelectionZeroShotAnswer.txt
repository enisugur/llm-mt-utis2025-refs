Explanation:

Given the described operation is a face-milling task with moderate spindle speed (600 RPM) and moderate feed rate (180 mm/min), targeting shallow depth of cut (0.5 mm step-down) with a total allowance of 2 mm stock removal, we can suggest suitable recommendations as follows:

1. Tool Type:
   - Face Milling Cutter (Indexable inserts), suitable for facing operations due to their stability, capability of taking wider cutting widths (large diameter) and efficient chip evacuation.
   - Recommended cutter type: Indexable insert face mill cutter with multiple edges (4–6 insert pockets), providing good productivity, strength and reliable face milling results.

2. Tool Material:
   - Carbide (coated): Preferred for general steel machining, providing good balance of toughness, resistance to wear and heat, as well as reliable performance under moderate speeds and feeds encountered here.
   - PVD or CVD coated carbide inserts are suitable for enhanced durability, excellent wear resistance and improved performance.

3. Tool Geometry Parameters:
   - Insert Geometry: Positive geometry inserts recommended due to shallow depth of cut (0.5mm), ensuring lower cutting force, reduced vibration, and smoother surface finish.
   - Cutting Edge Angle (Lead angle): Typically 45° or 75° degree lead angle face milling tools are advised; a 45° cutter angle is a good balance between radial and axial force distribution and ensures smoother entry into the workpiece.
   - Nose radius: Moderate nose radius recommended (approximately 0.8–1.2 mm), improving surface finish and extending tool life under stated operating conditions.
   - Relief angle: Moderate clearance angles around 7°–11°, ensuring chip clearance and reducing friction.
   - Rake Angle: A positive rake angle (7° to 15°) should be chosen to lower cutting resistance, facilitate smoother chip evacuation and reduce cutting forces.

Summary suggestions:

- Tool type: Indexable face milling cutter.
- Tool material: Coated carbide (PVD or CVD).
- Geometry parameters:
  - Insert geometry: Positive geometry
  - Cutting edge (Lead angle): 45° recommended  
  - Nose radius: approximately 0.8–1.2 mm  
  - Relief angle: 7° – 11°  
  - Positive rake angle: 7°–15°  

This recommended combination provides good cutting stability, reduction of cutting forces, effective chip control, long tool life, and superior finish quality for the stated face milling operation.
