I'll simulate a discussion between four experts analyzing this machining operation. Let's call them Expert A (Tool Geometry Specialist), Expert B (Material Science Specialist), Expert C (CNC Programming Specialist), and Expert D (Cutting Parameters Specialist).

Expert A (Tool Geometry Specialist):
"Looking at the tool geometry, we have a 25mm diameter face mill with 3 flutes and a 45° cutting edge angle. With coated carbide tools on medium carbon steel, I would initially suggest:
- Cutting speed (Vc): 180-220 m/min
- Feed per tooth (fz): 0.15-0.20 mm/tooth
Based on these, and using the formula:
n = (Vc × 1000)/(π × D), the spindle speed should be around 2290-2800 RPM."

Expert B (Material Science Specialist):
"Considering C40 (AISI 1040) steel has a hardness typically between 170-210 HB and contains 0.37-0.44% carbon, I would actually recommend slightly lower values:
- Cutting speed (Vc): 150-180 m/min
- Feed per tooth (fz): 0.1-0.15 mm/tooth
The material's machinability rating suggests we should be more conservative than Expert A's values."

Expert C (CNC Programming Specialist):
"Looking at the program structure with a 0.5mm depth of cut, which is relatively light, I agree more with Expert B's conservative approach. The G43 tool length compensation and 10mm rapid approach show it's a finishing operation. I support Expert B's recommendations."

Expert D (Cutting Parameters Specialist):
"After analyzing everyone's input, I agree with Expert B and C. For a face milling operation on AISI 1040 with a coated carbide tool, here's my calculation:
- Cutting speed (Vc): 165 m/min (middle ground)
- Feed per tooth (fz): 0.12 mm/tooth
- Spindle speed (n) = (165 × 1000)/(π × 25) ≈ 2100 RPM
- Feed rate = n × fz × number of flutes = 2100 × 0.12 × 3 = 756 mm/min"

Expert A: "I acknowledge my initial values were too aggressive. I'll step back from the discussion."

Summary and Recommendations:
Based on the expert discussion, here are the final recommended parameters:

1. Cutting Speed (Vc): 150-180 m/min
2. Spindle Speed: 1900-2300 RPM
3. Feed per tooth: 0.1-0.15 mm/tooth
4. Feed Rate: 570-1035 mm/min

Main points of conflict and resolution:
1. Initial disagreement between Expert A and B regarding cutting speeds, resolved in favor of more conservative values due to material properties
2. Feed rate ranges were adjusted downward considering the finishing operation nature
3. Final consensus achieved between experts B, C, and D, with Expert A acknowledging their initial values were too aggressive

Recommended program values:
```
G43 Z25.
G0 Z10.
G1 Z-0.5 F750
```
(Using middle-range values for feed rate)
