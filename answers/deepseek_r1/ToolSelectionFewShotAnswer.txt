Let me analyze the operation and suggest suitable tooling parameters.

Analysis of the Operation:
- Operation Type: Face Milling
- Total Depth: 2 mm
- Step Depth: 0.5 mm (meaning 4 passes required)
- Cutting Parameters:
  - Feed rate: 180 mm/min
  - Spindle speed: 600 RPM
  - Safe Z height: 5mm above workpiece

Recommended Tool Parameters:

Tool Type: Face Milling Cutter
- Length: 80 mm (sufficient for the operation with safe clearance)
- Diameter: 63 mm (standard size for face milling)
- Number of Flutes: 5 (optimal for face milling with given parameters)
- Tool Cutting Edge Angle: 45° (provides good chip evacuation and cutting force distribution)

Tool Material: Carbide with TiAlN Coating
Reasoning:
- The moderate cutting speed and feed rate suggest a general-purpose face milling operation
- TiAlN coating provides:
  - Better wear resistance
  - Higher heat resistance
  - Longer tool life
  - Good performance in both wet and dry cutting conditions

Additional Geometry Parameters:
- Rake Angle: +6°
- Relief Angle: 11°
- Corner Radius: 0.8 mm

The suggested tool configuration will provide:
1. Good surface finish
2. Efficient chip evacuation
3. Stable cutting process
4. Extended tool life
5. Optimal cutting force distribution

These parameters are suitable for general face milling operations with the given cutting parameters (600 RPM, 180 mm/min feed rate) while maintaining good tool life and surface quality.
