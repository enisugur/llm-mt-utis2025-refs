I'll simulate a discussion between four CNC machining experts analyzing this operation. Let's call them Expert A, B, C, and D.

Expert A (Tool Design Specialist):
"Based on the operation parameters, I suggest:
- Tool Type: Face mill cutter with multiple inserts
- Tool Material: Coated Carbide (preferably AlTiN coating)
- Geometry: 45° lead angle, positive rake angle around 12°
The relatively low spindle speed (600 RPM) and feed rate suggests we're likely working with a harder material, hence my coating suggestion."

Expert B (Process Engineer):
"I agree with the face mill selection, but let me add:
- Tool Type: Face mill with high-feed geometry
- Tool Material: Cermet inserts
- Geometry: 90° lead angle, positive axial rake 6°
With 0.5mm depth per step and 180mm/min feed rate, we could benefit from cermet's better finish capabilities."

Expert C (Manufacturing Technologist):
"I see some issues with Expert B's suggestion. With such a low spindle speed, cermet might be too brittle. My recommendation:
- Tool Type: Face mill with round inserts
- Tool Material: Coated Carbide (CVD coating)
- Geometry: 65° lead angle, positive rake angle 8-10°
The round inserts would provide better tool life in this case."

Expert B leaves the discussion: "I acknowledge my mistake regarding cermet inserts - the speeds are indeed too low for optimal cermet performance."

Expert D (Cutting Tool Specialist):
"I largely agree with Expert A, but with some modifications:
- Tool Type: Face mill with square inserts
- Tool Material: Coated Carbide (TiCN-Al₂O₃ multilayer coating)
- Geometry: 45° lead angle, positive rake angle 10°
The multilayer coating would provide better wear resistance at these cutting parameters."

Summary of Final Recommendations:
1. Tool Type: Consensus on face mill cutter, but conflict between square vs. round inserts
2. Tool Material: Agreement on coated carbide, with debate between:
   - AlTiN coating (Expert A)
   - CVD coating (Expert C)
   - TiCN-Al₂O₃ multilayer coating (Expert D)
3. Tool Geometry:
   - Lead Angle: Majority favor 45° (Experts A and D), while Expert C suggests 65°
   - Rake Angle: Range between 8-12° positive rake, with general agreement

Main Conflicts:
1. Insert shape (round vs. square)
2. Coating type selection
3. Lead angle optimization (45° vs. 65°)

The final selection would depend on additional factors like workpiece material and surface finish requirements, which weren't specified in the original operation description.
