# G-Code Analysis

## Operation Type
This G-code represents a **2D profile milling operation** performed in multiple depth passes. The operation is executed in the XY plane (G17) with the tool progressively cutting deeper into the material.

## Geometric Description

The operation mills a complex 2D profile with the following characteristics:

1. **Profile Shape**: A complex shape consisting of:
   - Straight line segments
   - Circular arcs (both clockwise G2 and counterclockwise G3)
   
2. **Depth Strategy**:
   - The operation is performed in 4 depth passes:
     - First pass at Z=1.5mm (lines N33-N50)
     - Second pass at Z=1.0mm (lines N52-N69)
     - Third pass at Z=0.5mm (lines N71-N88)
     - Final pass at Z=0.0mm (lines N90-N107)

3. **Tool Path Description**:
   - The path starts at position X-46.138 Y23.724
   - Follows a series of straight lines and arcs to create the profile
   - Contains two circular pockets/features:
     - One with clockwise arcs (G2) centered around X28.827 Y16.442
     - Another with counterclockwise arcs (G3) in the lower portion of the profile
   - The tool path forms what appears to be a complex contour with rounded features

4. **Machining Parameters**:
   - Spindle speed: 600 RPM (S600)
   - Feed rate: 180 mm/min (F180)
   - Coolant is active during cutting (M8)

5. **Coordinate System**:
   - Uses G54 work coordinate system
   - Operates in absolute positioning mode (G90)
   - Uses metric units (G710)

The profile appears to be a complex shape with both straight edges and curved features, potentially representing a part with functional contours or pockets.
