I'll help analyze the machining parameters and suggest suitable cutting speed and feed rate for your face-milling operation.

Analysis:

1. Workpiece Material:
- C40/AISI 1040 Steel
- Medium carbon steel (0.40% carbon content)
- Hardness typically 170-210 HB
- Good machinability rating

2. Tool Specifications:
- Facing mill with coated carbide inserts
- Tool diameter: 25 mm
- Number of flutes: 3
- Tool cutting edge angle: 45Â°
- Suitable for face milling operations

3. Operation Details:
- Face milling operation
- Depth of cut: 0.5 mm (light cut)
- Total stock to remove: 2 mm

Recommended Cutting Parameters:

1. Cutting Speed:
- For coated carbide tools on AISI 1040 steel in face milling:
- Recommended cutting speed range: 150-220 m/min
- Given the moderate depth of cut and good tool specifications, I recommend:
  Cutting Speed = 180 m/min

2. Feed Rate:
- Feed per tooth (fz) range for this operation: 0.1-0.2 mm/tooth
- Considering the tool diameter and moderate depth of cut:
  Feed per tooth = 0.15 mm/tooth

3. Calculated Parameters:
For Spindle Speed (n):
$$n = \frac{v_c \times 1000}{\pi \times D} = \frac{180 \times 1000}{\pi \times 25} = 2292\: \text{rpm}$$

For Feed Rate (vf):
$$v_f = f_z \times z \times n = 0.15 \times 3 \times 2292 = 1032\: \text{mm/min}$$

Final Recommendations:
- Cutting Speed (vc): 180 m/min
- Spindle Speed (n): 2292 rpm
- Feed per tooth (fz): 0.15 mm/tooth
- Feed Rate (vf): 1032 mm/min

Additional Recommendations:
1. Use flood coolant for better tool life and surface finish
2. Monitor tool wear regularly
3. Start with these values and adjust if needed based on:
   - Surface finish requirements
   - Tool wear rate
   - Machine stability
   - Power availability

These parameters should provide a good balance between productivity and tool life while maintaining good surface finish quality.
