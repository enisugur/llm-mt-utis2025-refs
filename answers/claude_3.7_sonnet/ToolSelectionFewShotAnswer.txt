Let me analyze the operation and suggest suitable tooling parameters.

Analysis of the Operation:
- Operation Type: Face Milling
- Total Depth: 2 mm
- Step Depth: 0.5 mm (meaning 4 passes required)
- Cutting Parameters:
  - Feed Rate: 180 mm/min
  - Spindle Speed: 600 RPM
  - Safe Z height: 5mm above workpiece

Recommended Tool Specifications:

Tool Type: Face Mill (Shell Mill)
- Length: 80 mm
- Diameter: 63 mm (standard size for face milling)
- Number of Flutes: 5
- Tool Cutting Edge Angle: 45°
- Tool Material: Carbide inserts with TiAlN coating

Rationale:
1. The 63mm diameter is chosen because:
   - Provides good surface coverage
   - Allows for stable cutting with the given parameters
   - Common size for face milling operations

2. 5 flutes are recommended because:
   - Provides good balance between material removal and chip evacuation
   - Suitable for the moderate feed rate (180 mm/min)
   - Helps achieve better surface finish

3. The 45° cutting edge angle is optimal for:
   - Reducing cutting forces
   - Better chip evacuation
   - Improved tool life

4. TiAlN coated carbide inserts are suggested because:
   - Good wear resistance
   - Suitable for various materials
   - Can handle the heat generated at 600 RPM
   - Provides longer tool life

Additional Recommendations:
- Use coolant during operation
- Monitor tool wear after each operation
- Consider increasing feed rate if material allows
- Ensure rigid tool holding to minimize vibration
