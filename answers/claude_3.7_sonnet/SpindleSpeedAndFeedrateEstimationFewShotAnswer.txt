I'll help you calculate the appropriate cutting parameters for your face milling operation.

For C40 (AISI 1040) steel with a coated carbide facing tool, here's the analysis:

1. Material Characteristics:
- C40 (AISI 1040) is a medium carbon steel
- Hardness typically ranges 170-210 HB
- Good machinability rating

2. Tool Characteristics Analysis:
- Coated carbide allows for higher cutting speeds
- 3 flutes is good for general-purpose face milling
- 45° cutting edge angle is standard for face milling
- 25mm diameter is a medium-size facing tool

3. Cutting Parameter Calculations:

For Roughing:
- Recommended cutting speed (Vc) = 160 m/min
- Spindle Speed (n) = (Vc × 1000)/(π × D)
- n = (160 × 1000)/(π × 25) = 2,037 RPM
- Feed per tooth (fz) = 0.15 mm/tooth
- Feed rate = n × fz × number of flutes
- Feed rate = 2,037 × 0.15 × 3 = 916.65 mm/min

For Finishing:
- Cutting speed (Vc) = 200 m/min
- Spindle Speed = (200 × 1000)/(π × 25) = 2,546 RPM
- Feed per tooth = 0.1 mm/tooth
- Feed rate = 2,546 × 0.1 × 3 = 763.8 mm/min

Recommended Parameters:
```
Spindle Speed for Roughing: 2000 RPM
Spindle Speed for Finishing: 2500 RPM
Feedrate for roughing: 900 mm/min 
Feedrate for finishing: 750 mm/min
```

These parameters take into account:
1. The relatively small tool diameter (25mm)
2. The moderate hardness of C40 steel
3. The shallow depth of cut (0.5mm)
4. The use of coated carbide tooling
5. The 3-flute configuration

Note: These values can be adjusted based on:
- Machine stability and rigidity
- Surface finish requirements
- Tool wear observations
- Power availability of the machine
- Workpiece fixturing stability
